This project features a Java raw-image-decoder with a UI to change gamma.  It's not a finished project; it's just an example of an object-oriented port of a RAW image decoder written in C program.

There are interesting parts of this code, particularly in the various iterators that traverse the image (similar to a convolution kernel), and also in the abstractions of the Bayer sensor mosaic filter.  There is also Swing component that visualizes the image, and a little gamma adjuster.

I dropped work on the project as Apple and Adobe simultaneously released their digital asset management systems in the form of Aperture and Lightroom.  This project was still incredibly exciting, and filled with technical challenges.
